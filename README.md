# Quality of Life - A Minecraft Mod

This is an opinionated data pack to improve quality of life in vanilla Minecraft single-player gameplay.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/rlan/quality-of-life/wiki) for changes to the vanilla game.


## Prerequisite

Minecraft Java Edition 1.14 or later.


## Installation

1. Download this repo as a zip.
2. Install via these [instructions](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Installing_a_data_pack).

Note: installing to a modded game is untested.


## Uninstallation

This data pack does not modify any part of the saved game. Only gameplay is modified. To uninstall this data pack, simply undo the changes made during installation, i.e., delete `quality-of-life` folder from the saved game's `datapacks` folder.


## TODO

See [issues](https://github.com/rlan/quality-of-life/issues). Please make proposals there.
